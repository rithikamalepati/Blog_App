This blog web application is a simple, user-friendly platform built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS as the templating engine. The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts without using a database, meaning posts will not persist between sessions. The application emphasizes a clean and responsive design to enhance the user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
